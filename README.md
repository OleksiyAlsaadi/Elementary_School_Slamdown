# Elementary_School_Slamdown

Navigate the blacktop of an elementary school, battling other students amidst trading card hysteria. Interact with other students and become the hero (or renegade anti-hero) the schoolyard never knew it needed. 

* Choose from dozens of hand drawn cards with unique abilities. * Multiple endings based on the choices you make and the reputation you receive. 

* This video game prototype was made as part of a college game design course and was created in the Unity 3D engine.

A Unity game prototype developed in a game design over the course of a semester with a team of three. As programmer, I coded the game logic in C#. Later released online.
